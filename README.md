# Food-Fantasy-Bar-Menu-Generators

This is just C++ programs that randomly generate possible menus for the bar in Food Fantasy.

For each menu generated, it will show a list of the drink names, the total bar tokens (money) and bar coins (fame) they will give you assuming there's no favorite drink bonuses, and the total amount of each ingredient that will be used to make the drinks.

There are separate programs for each level of the bar, starting at level 5.
These programs assume that you are not spending crystals to refresh the ingredients market.
This will be updated as I level up my bar, so if you're ahead of me then sorry.

I have taken one (1) programming class ever and these programs are primarily made for myself, so this is far from effient or professional. I don't know what the hell I'm doing.

I don't think you can run programs on github. You gotta download something like dev-c++, put the code in there, and then compile & run it.
