# Food-Fantasy-Bar-Menu-Generators

This is just C++ programs that automatically generate possible menus for the bar in Food Fantasy.

There are separate programs for each level of the bar, starting at level 5.
These programs assume that you are not spending crystals to refresh the ingredients market.

This will be updated as I level up my bar, so if you're ahead of me then sorry.

I have taken one (1) programming class ever, so this code and this repository thing are far from effient or professional.
